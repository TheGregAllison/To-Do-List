# To-Do-List
This app is a to-do list that allows the user to add and remove items as needed. Simply type in the list item you wish to append to the list and hit enter or the "add" button. To remove an item from the list, click the "x" to the right of the item. To cross an item off your list, you can simply double-click or double-tap the item and it will be crossed off. The items in the list can also be reorganized however you wish by clicking/tapping and draggging. 

## This program is built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES13). This project also uses JQuery v3.7.1.
